I'm a machine learning engineer passionate about deep learning, machine learning and data science in general. I'm mainly focused on natural language processing, even if I enjoy computer vision as well.

Beyond data science, I'm fascinated by design and UX. I'm convinced that a good UX is sometimes a serious alternative to machine learning-based solutions.

 I have a tendency of falling in the [productivity tool rabbit hole](http://www.sridattalabs.com/2012/02/06/rabbit-holes-being-smart-hurts-prod/), so I may occasionally post articles about productivity tool from a data science perspective.

And thanks to [Smashicons](https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons) for the lovely pancake pan icon!
